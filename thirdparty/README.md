This dictory has a third-party product to generate dsdgen:

- ./tpcds-kit
This repository is cloned from 'https://github.com/davies/tpcds-kit' at commit 39a63a4fa8cc349dc033b990c4ae36fad9110b1b.
The repository was originally forked from 'https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit';
the original one was based on v2.5.0 and it supported macos platforms.
This repository modifies some code to generate TPC-DS data in a distributed way.
By compiling code in the repository, we have put pre-built dsdgen in 'src/main/resources/binaries'
for Mac/Linux x86_64 platforms.
